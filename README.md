# So What? Tableau Extension

## What is it?

**So What?** is a powerful Tableau extension designed to transform raw dashboard data into actionable insights. Often, data presentations leave users with the key question: "So what?" This extension bridges that gap by leveraging GPT to analyze and interpret your data, providing clear, actionable recommendations.

For example, when presenting a turnover rate of 3%, the extension goes beyond just the numbers, answering critical questions such as “What does this mean for our business?” and “What actions should we take?” It could suggest strategies for reducing turnover costs or optimizing resource allocation, helping you make informed decisions that drive real value.

**So What?** ensures that every piece of data is not just presented but analyzed, delivering practical insights and strategic recommendations for effective data-driven decision-making.
